# churn_customer_prediction_
ML model for predicting customer churn
Churn Customer Prediction using LightGBM
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn using the LightGBM algorithm. The project focuses on hyperparameter tuning, evaluation metrics, and robust preprocessing techniques.

üîç Problem Statement
Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or subscribers. Identifying customers who are likely to leave a service helps businesses take proactive measures to improve customer retention.
